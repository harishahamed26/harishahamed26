### Hi there 👋

🚀 Highly motivated MSc AI graduate with a passion for innovation in artificial intelligence. 💡 Proficient in ML, NLP-LLM, and data analysis, I thrive on solving complex problems. 🎓 Education includes an MSc in AI from Birmingham City University and a BE in Computer Science.

💼 With over 2 years at Cognizant, I've honed my skills in Cobol, Informatica, SQL, and Agile methodologies. I've streamlined data workflows, generated reports, and worked closely with insurance clients. 

💡 My project portfolio showcases diverse talents, from car evaluation using Decision Trees to image classification using CNN. 

🤖 Notably, I've integrated a CSV agent chatbot with LLM, providing food recommendations, and I'm currently developing a cutting-edge conversational model platform for healthcare professionals using OpenAI's LLM, primed for A/B testing.

🛠️ Technical expertise spans Python, NumPy, Power BI, and OpenAI's LLM and Langchain. I'm adept in AI, ML, deep learning, and database systems like MySQL and MongoDB.

🤝 My soft skills include adaptability, self-motivation, and problem-solving, complemented by a knack for collaboration and organizational prowess.

🌐 Fluent in English and Tamil, I've also actively participated in hackathons and hold certifications in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning.

Ready to embark on transformative AI projects! Connect with me on LinkedIn for collaboration opportunities. 📊🤖🔗
